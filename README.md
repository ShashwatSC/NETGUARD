Digital imaging technology have developed rapidly in the last few years. 
The increase in computing power has led to significant advances in the field of computer vision. 
The ability to quickly and accurately recognize faces and objects in a dynamic, immersive environment holds great promise for improving security, performance, and user experience. 
Among these, facial recognition and real-time object detection have gained importance in many fields, from surveillance and security to interactive technology.
The main purpose of real-time face and object detection is to detect and identify faces and objects in the visual field. 
The technology has applications in many areas, including human- computer interaction, augmented R, security monitoring and self-management. 
The challenge is not only to achieve high accuracy, but also to speed up processing time, which is an important aspect of applications that require immediate and effective response.
The development of face and object detection has changed from the management of traditional methods based on manual operations to deep learning, such as network neural networks (CNN), which have been proven to be especially good in Hierarchical terms.
The representation is learned from raw image data and allows the elimination of difficult features important for accurate detection. Integrating deep neural networks into real-time systems requires solving computational problems to ensure zero accuracy.
Tensor Flow is an open-source tool which is used for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It uses a deep learning concept which is mainly used in the interface of the application. 
It uses Tensor Flow to generate a CNN algorithm to identify hand gestures. Keras is used as the interface to access the Tensor Flow library. 
A user-friendly interface for training and building the translator and implementing CNN is done using Keras. It is also responsible for data abstraction as to reduce major complexities. 
It helps with the concepts of deep learning and necessary tools.
